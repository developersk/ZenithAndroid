### Main Idea
We propose an app that provides Real-time correctness of Yoga posture using Image Processing from images captured
by Smartphone’s Camera under different lighting conditions. Accuracy of posture is calculated using optical intensity
measurement in real-time from images captured using smartphone’s camera. The idea is based on the fact that our body
can be distinctly identified by a set of 15 points . The underlying principle is to analyze the posture variations in the time-
series body posture images and calculate their accuracy.
Focus would be to create an app that is simple, easy to use and provide accurate results under various lightening
conditions.
